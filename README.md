# song-to-anki

I like to learn languages by listening to music in foreign languages, and this server-side project supports web and mobile clients that help me do that!

Code in this repo is deployed to Herkou in a Docker container and services requests from a custom `Anki-Android` fork as well as a chrome extension for learning languages through music.
